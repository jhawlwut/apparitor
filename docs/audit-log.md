# Audit log: stability contract

Every authorization decision emits one structured log line on the `apparitor` logger.
This document freezes the schema from `0.1.0` as a stability contract. A failure in
`tests/unit/test_log_contract.py` is a breaking log-schema change; see the stability
policy below.

## Logger

A single `logging.getLogger("apparitor")` is shared across all modules (`engine.py`,
`mapping.py`, `fastmcp.py`, `a2a.py`). Levels used:

| Level | When |
| --- | --- |
| `INFO` | Contract lines (C1, C2, C3); adapter startup lines |
| `WARNING` | Operator-actionable conditions (mapping failure, PDP error, cache bypass, collapse guard) |
| `ERROR` / `exception` | Internal faults, adapter errors |

**Sensitivity:** subject ids are the decision principals and may be email addresses or
other user identifiers. Route the `apparitor` logger to a restricted sink accordingly.

## Contract lines (frozen from 0.1.0)

### C1: decision audit record

Emitted by `_log` in `engine.py` at `INFO` level for every authorization call that
produces a decision (skip paths are silent; see below).

**Format string:**

```
apparitor decision verdict=%s status=%s subjects=%s correlation=%s resources=%s fingerprints=%s latency_ms=%.1f
```

**Rendered example:**

```
apparitor decision verdict=allow status=success subjects=['alice@acme.com', 'travel-bot'] correlation=corr-42 resources=['files/read'] fingerprints=['3a9f1c20e741'] latency_ms=12.3
```

**Field table:**

| Field | Type | Semantics | Can be None? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `verdict` | `str` enum | Authorization outcome: `allow`, `block`, `human_review` | No |
| `status` | `str` enum | Evaluation path: `success`, `error` | No |
| `subjects` | Python-repr list of strings | Sorted, deduplicated subject **ids only** (no type); one entry per distinct principal | No |
| `correlation` | `str` or `None` | Value of `correlation_id` from the request context, rendered as the literal `None` when absent, never omitted | Yes (renders as `None`) |
| `resources` | Python-repr list of strings | Resource ids, positional per evaluation request; dual-principal = two entries (one per leg), duplicates expected | No |
| `fingerprints` | Python-repr list of strings | 12-character hex digests, positional per request (same order as `resources`) | No |
| `latency_ms` | `float`, always one decimal (`%.1f`) | Wall-clock time from first `perf_counter` to emit, in milliseconds | No |

**Notes:**

- `subjects=` is the Python repr of a sorted, deduplicated list of subject id strings.
  Under dual-principal evaluation this names both the user and the agent. The list is
  always sorted so parsers can rely on stable ordering.
- `correlation=` renders the literal string `None` (not omitted, not JSON `null`) when no
  `correlation_id` is present in the request context.
- `resources=` and `fingerprints=` carry one entry per `EvaluationRequest` sent to the
  PDP. A dual-principal call emits two entries even when the resource id is identical for
  both legs.
- C1 is **not** emitted on SKIP paths (empty tool-call list, mapper abstention on all
  calls). Silence is by design on skip; there is nothing to audit. SKIP paths emit no C1
  line; in practice verdict is `allow`|`block`|`human_review` and status is
  `success`|`error`.

### C2: batch denied-legs companion

Emitted in `_evaluate_batch` in `engine.py` at `INFO` level. Companion to C1 on
multi-request batches (the aggregate enforcement path, `/evaluations`) where the aggregate
verdict is not `allow`. The per-item `evaluate_each` path also uses a batch PDP call but
emits C3, never C2. C2 belongs to the aggregate enforcement path only.

**Format string:**

```
apparitor batch denied_legs=%s
```

**Rendered example:**

```
apparitor batch denied_legs=['user:alice@acme.com tool_call.execute files/delete', 'agent:travel-bot tool_call.execute files/delete']
```

**Field table:**

| Field | Type | Semantics | Can be None? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `denied_legs` | Python-repr list of strings | One entry per denied leg; each entry: `<subject.type>:<subject.id> <action.name> <resource.id>` | No (empty list not emitted; a non-ALLOW aggregate from `aggregate()` implies at least one decision was false, so `denied_legs` is never empty when C2 fires) |

**Notes:**

- C2 carries `type:id` in each entry (asymmetry with C1 `subjects=`, which carries id
  only). This lets an operator distinguish a user-grant deny from an agent-boundary deny
  at a glance.
- C2 never carries raw arguments or request context.
- C2 only fires on multi-request batches (`/evaluations`); single-request denies produce
  C1 only.

### C3: evaluate_each summary

Emitted in `_emit_each` in `engine.py` at `INFO` level. Advisory summary for
`evaluate_each` (per-item visibility filtering, e.g. `tools/list`). **Not an audit
record**: no subjects, resources, fingerprints, or correlation id.

**Format string:**

```
apparitor per-item decisions verdicts=%s latency_ms=%.1f
```

**Rendered example:**

```
apparitor per-item decisions verdicts=['allow', 'block'] latency_ms=8.4
```

**Field table:**

| Field | Type | Semantics | Can be None? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `verdicts` | Python-repr list of strings | One verdict string per call, positional | No |
| `latency_ms` | `float`, always one decimal (`%.1f`) | Shared batch latency in milliseconds | No |

**Notes:**

- C3 is advisory only. Do not rely on it for audit, alerting, or access-control decisions;
  use C1 for enforcement-path records.
- Verdicts in `evaluate_each` counters are indistinguishable from C1 enforcement decisions
  in the metrics sink; account for that when alerting on block rates.

## Timestamps and clock

The contract lines deliberately carry **no timestamp token**: the `logging.LogRecord`'s
`created` attribute (rendered via your formatter's `%(asctime)s`) is the time source, as
is standard for Python logging. Two consequences for deployments that keep these lines as
audit records.

- **Configure the formatter** on the `apparitor` logger's handler to emit an ISO-8601
  UTC timestamp (e.g. `%(asctime)s` with a UTC converter). A sink that stores only
  `getMessage()` without record metadata has no event time and cannot serve as an audit
  trail.
- The host's clock is the clock of record. Run NTP-disciplined clocks on enforcement
  points in regulated deployments.

## Parsing guidance

- List-valued fields (`subjects=`, `resources=`, `fingerprints=`, `verdicts=`,
  `denied_legs=`) are Python `repr` output using single quotes, not JSON. Parse them with
  `ast.literal_eval` rather than a JSON parser.
- Anchor on the prefixes `apparitor decision `, `apparitor batch `, and
  `apparitor per-item ` to identify contract lines; the suffix fields follow in order.
- Treat the rendered line as the interface. The log record `msg` / `args` structure is
  internal; `LogRecord.getMessage()` (the formatted string) is the stable surface.
- `latency_ms=` always has exactly one decimal place (`\d+\.\d`).
- `fingerprints=` entries match `[0-9a-f]{12}`.

## Fingerprint derivation

Each fingerprint is the first 12 hex characters of the SHA-256 over the canonical JSON
(`json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))`) of the full `EvaluationRequest`
tuple (subject + action + resource including arguments + context). This is the same digest
as the ALLOW cache key.

**What the fingerprint covers depends on `redact_arguments`:**

- With `redact_arguments=False` (non-default): argument values are hashed in full, so the
  fingerprint uniquely identifies a specific call including its argument values.
- With `redact_arguments=True` (default): argument values are replaced with
  `"***redacted***"` before hashing, so the fingerprint covers the tool/resource/subject/
  action/context plus argument **key names** only. Two calls differing only in argument
  **values** will produce the same fingerprint.

This is a contract fact: do not rely on fingerprints to distinguish calls that differ only
in argument values unless `redact_arguments=False` is explicitly configured.

## What is deliberately never logged

- **Raw tool arguments.** Arguments are fingerprinted; the digest identifies a call
  without exposing possibly-sensitive argument values.
- **Tokens and credentials.** No bearer tokens, API keys, or session material ever appear
  in any log line.
- **Engine reasons toward the wire.** Refusals exposed to callers are generic
  (`"blocked by authorization policy"`); the rich reason stays in the operator log.
- **Subject types.** C1 `subjects=` carries ids only. Type information appears in C2
  `denied_legs=` entries.

**Treat the `apparitor` logger as sensitive.** Subject ids are the decision principals and
may be email addresses or other user identifiers. Route this logger to a restricted,
access-controlled sink and do not forward it to end users.

## Informational lines (not part of the contract)

Informational lines use the `apparitor: <message>` form (colon after `apparitor`); contract
lines use `apparitor decision|batch|per-item` (no colon). That delimiter difference is the
operator's separator. Informational lines are **not** part of the stability contract and
may change without notice.

## Regulatory mapping (EU)

The schema is designed so the operator's sink can satisfy the EU obligations that most
commonly attach to agent authorization records. apparitor provides the *recording
capability*; retention, residency, and access control are properties of the sink you
route the `apparitor` logger to. Confirm applicability with your compliance function. This
section maps the schema, it is not legal advice.

| Obligation | How the schema relates |
| --- | --- |
| **AI Act (Reg. (EU) 2024/1689) Art. 12, record-keeping.** High-risk AI systems must technically allow automatic recording of events enabling traceability of the system's functioning. | C1 is that record for the authorization function: per-decision outcome, every principal involved, the resource acted on, and a per-call fingerprint. Set `correlation_id` on every request so decisions chain to sessions/tasks. For regulated deployments treat it as required, not optional. |
| **AI Act Arts. 19 / 26(6), log retention.** Providers and deployers of high-risk systems keep automatically generated logs at least **six months** (longer where other law requires). | Retention happens at the sink, not in apparitor (persistence is deliberately out of scope pre-`v0.1`). Route the logger to a sink with a retention policy meeting your role's obligation. |
| **AI Act Art. 14, human oversight.** | `verdict=human_review` records that a decision was escalated to a human. Who reviewed it and the outcome happen outside apparitor. Your review workflow must produce its own record and can join on `correlation` / `fingerprints`. |
| **GDPR (Reg. (EU) 2016/679), personal data in logs.** | `subjects=` ids and `denied_legs=` entries are personal data when they identify people (emails). You need a lawful basis (security/audit logging is commonly Art. 6(1)(f)); minimization is designed in (no raw arguments, no tokens, generic wire reasons); prefer pseudonymous subject ids from your IdP where policy allows. Fingerprints are **pseudonymized, not anonymous**: the digest is linkable to the request tuple by anyone who can reconstruct it. |
| **GDPR Arts. 5(1)(e), 17, storage limitation and erasure.** | Audit retention and erasure requests are in tension; Art. 17(3)(b)/(e) exemptions (legal obligation, legal claims) typically cover security audit trails for their retention window. Pseudonymous subject ids make this materially easier. Decide before go-live, not at the first request. |
| **GDPR Ch. V / data sovereignty.** | Routing the `apparitor` logger to a sink outside the EU/EEA is a personal-data transfer. If residency is a requirement, the log pipeline (not just the PDP) must stay in-region. |
| **NIS2 (Dir. (EU) 2022/2555) / DORA (Reg. (EU) 2022/2554).** | The decision log feeds detection and incident reconstruction (denied legs name which principal was stopped, fail-closed errors are visible at WARNING/ERROR). Integrity protection (append-only storage, tamper evidence) is a sink property; these lines carry no signatures. |

One known limitation to weigh for AI Act traceability: with the default
`redact_arguments=True`, the input data of a call is represented only by argument **key
names** inside the fingerprint (see above). Some obligations require reconstructing *what*
was attempted, not just *that* it was attempted, by whom, on which resource. Those
deployments must either set `redact_arguments=False` (weigh the GDPR minimization cost) or
keep input records in an adjacent system joined via `correlation`.

## Stability policy

From `0.1.0` the contract lines C1, C2, and C3 are **append-only**: new `key=value`
tokens may be added at the **end** of a line in a future release. Renames, removals, and
semantic changes to existing tokens are breaking and require:

1. A `CHANGELOG.md` entry under **Changed** with the text **"Update log parsers"**.
2. A version bump per semantic versioning.

`tests/unit/test_log_contract.py` pins the documented grammar; a failure there means a
breaking change is in flight.

**Out of scope (tracked, deferred):** structured log persistence, cross-session
aggregation, retention, and compliance export are post-`v0.1` work items. See
[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).
