"""NeMo Guardrails rail adapter (thin adapter over :class:`AuthorizationEngine`).

This is the **only** module that imports NeMo Guardrails. The import is guarded so that
importing it without ``nemoguardrails`` installed yields a clear
:class:`~apparitor.errors.MissingDependencyError` rather than an opaque ``ImportError``.

It binds the firewall-free :class:`AuthorizationEngine` behind a NeMo **custom action** so a
NeMo-guarded agent gets the *identical* authorization check the LlamaFirewall scanner
provides — same engine, same mapper, same fail-closed semantics, same request-scoped subject
resolution (``current_subject`` / ``current_request_context`` / ``config.agent_id``). Only the
boundary differs: the verdict is mapped onto NeMo's allow / block(refuse) model.

The action returns a plain ``allowed`` boolean — the contract NeMo's ``output_mapping``
expects (``True`` = allowed) and one that fails *closed* even under NeMo's default mapping
(a non-true return blocks). The richer verdict (verdict / reason / status / score) is surfaced
through ``ActionResult.context_updates`` so a host can build a refusal message or an escalation
flow on top of it. The verdict → allow mapping is fail-closed: only ``ALLOW`` / ``SKIP`` with a
non-error status is allowed; ``BLOCK``, ``HUMAN_REVIEW`` (refused; escalation is a host concern
surfaced via context), and any ``status=ERROR`` block.

Register the action on an ``LLMRails`` (before generating), then reference the flow as a rail.
NeMo has no built-in "tool calls" context key, so the host passes the agent's proposed tool
calls into the action explicitly as ``$tool_calls`` (or sets them in the rails context under
``tool_calls``); how you obtain them depends on your agent integration. Wiring::

    from nemoguardrails import LLMRails, RailsConfig

    rails = LLMRails(RailsConfig.from_path("config"))
    NeMoAuthorizationRails(pdp_url="https://pdp.internal").register(rails)

``config/config.yml`` activates the flow as a rail::

    rails:
      input:
        flows:
          - authorize tool calls

``config/rails.co`` refuses a denied tool call (the canonical ``self check input`` shape)::

    define bot refuse to authorize tool call
      "I can't authorize that action."

    define flow authorize tool calls
      $allowed = execute authorize_tool_calls(tool_calls=$tool_calls)
      if not $allowed
        bot refuse to authorize tool call
        stop

A ``HUMAN_REVIEW`` verdict refuses too (NeMo has no native human-in-the-loop pause); the
verdict is surfaced in the rails context, so a host builds escalation by branching on it, e.g.
``when $tool_authorization_verdict == "human_review"``.

The host sets the trusted subject/context out-of-band before invoking the rails — never from
model or tool output (a confused-deputy hazard) — exactly as with the scanner::

    with subject_scope(Subject(type="user", id="alice@acme.com")):
        await rails.generate_async(messages=...)
