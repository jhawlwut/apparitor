"""A2A agent-executor adapter (thin adapter over :class:`AuthorizationEngine`).

This is the **only** module that imports the A2A SDK. The import is guarded so that
importing it without ``a2a-sdk`` installed yields a clear
:class:`~apparitor.errors.MissingDependencyError` rather than an opaque ``ImportError``.

It binds the firewall-free :class:`AuthorizationEngine` in front of an A2A
``AgentExecutor`` so every agent-to-agent invocation (``message/send`` and streaming
variants) is authorized server-side, *before* the wrapped executor runs — the same engine,
fail-closed semantics and metrics as the LlamaFirewall scanner, the NeMo rail and the
FastMCP middleware; only the boundary differs. Like the FastMCP middleware (and unlike the
in-runtime firewall adapters), the subject can come from a **validated** identity: the
authenticated peer the A2A server's authentication layer established for the request —
never from anything inside the message.

Subject resolution (first match wins; no match refuses the invocation):

1. The authenticated caller from ``RequestContext.call_context.user`` →
   ``Subject(type="agent", id=<user_name>)`` — the A2A peer is typically itself an agent;
   ``subject_type`` is a constructor knob for deployments that authenticate end users.
2. A trusted subject placed in ``ServerCallContext.state["subject"]`` by the
   deployment's ``ServerCallContextBuilder`` — per-request and threaded through the SDK.
   The ambient contextvar seam the other adapters offer is deliberately **not** consulted
   here: the executor runs inside the SDK's detached, long-lived producer task, where
   contextvars are snapshotted at task creation and go stale across turns — a
   cross-request identity leak waiting to happen.
3. ``config.agent_id``, **only** when ``allow_static_subject=True`` (typed with
   ``config.subject_type``, deliberately distinct from the constructor's ``subject_type``,
   which types authenticated peers). Off by default: an unauthenticated network caller
   must never be silently authorized as a static subject (a confused deputy). Opt in only
   where the transport itself is trusted.

Host enrichment attributes (``conversation_id`` / ``user_id`` / ``correlation_id``) are
likewise read from ``ServerCallContext.state``, never from ambient context.

The AuthZEN tuple: action ``agent.invoke``; resource ``{type: "a2a_agent",
id: <agent_label>}``, or — when ``skill_resolver`` resolves a skill for the request —
``{type: "a2a_skill", id: "<agent_label>/<skill>"}`` (segments validated like every other
policy key: non-empty, no embedded ``/``; the skill is kept verbatim). **The resolver must
derive the skill from the exact field the delegate dispatches on** — deriving it from
caller-controlled metadata would let the caller pick which policy key is evaluated while
the delegate runs something else (authorization bypass by key-shifting). The A2A ``tenant``
rides along in the AuthZEN ``context`` for multi-tenant policies, beside the standard
host-context attributes — note it is the *request's* tenant as resolved by the SDK
(protocol routing data), so policies should treat it as a claim to check against the
subject, not as proof by itself.

Verdict mapping is fail-closed: only a clean ``ALLOW`` reaches the wrapped executor.
``BLOCK``, ``HUMAN_REVIEW`` and any error refuse by raising an A2A
``InvalidRequestError`` whose text the client receives **verbatim** — so refusals are
deliberately generic and the rich verdict/reason stays in the operator decision log and
metrics. ``InvalidRequestError`` maps to JSON-RPC -32600 / HTTP 400 / gRPC
``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` — semantically "invalid request" rather than "forbidden", but the
1.x SDK ships no authorization-flavored error. Note the SDK persists a ``failed`` task
for **every** refused invocation (its producer failure path), including unauthenticated
ones — reject unauthenticated traffic in HTTP/authn middleware to cap task-store growth —
and a denial on a follow-up turn fails the whole in-flight task, not just that turn.

Enforcement scope: every invocation path that runs the executor (``message/send`` and
``message/stream``, on JSON-RPC, REST and gRPC alike — all three transports share the
request handler). Task **reads** never touch the executor and are not gated here:
``tasks/get``/``tasks/list``/``tasks/subscribe`` return or stream task content, and
push-notification-config CRUD is likewise open — gate those in HTTP/authn middleware.
``cancel`` is passed through: the SDK cancels the producer task *before*
``executor.cancel`` runs, so gating at this seam could not actually prevent
cancellation — that, too, belongs in HTTP/authn middleware.

        MyExecutor(), pdp_url="https://pdp.internal", agent_label="travel-agent"
    )
    handler = DefaultRequestHandler(agent_executor=guarded, task_store=..., agent_card=...)

The adapter needs only the base ``a2a-sdk``; serving over HTTP additionally needs the
SDK's ``[http-server]`` extra, as in any A2A deployment.
