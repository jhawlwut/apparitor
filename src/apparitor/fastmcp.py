"""FastMCP server-middleware adapter (thin adapter over :class:`AuthorizationEngine`).

This is the **only** module that imports FastMCP. The import is guarded so that importing
it without ``fastmcp`` installed yields a clear
:class:`~apparitor.errors.MissingDependencyError` rather than an opaque ``ImportError``.

It binds the firewall-free :class:`AuthorizationEngine` behind a FastMCP **middleware** so
every MCP ``tools/call`` is authorized server-side, *before* the tool executes — the same
engine, mapper, fail-closed semantics and metrics as the LlamaFirewall scanner and the NeMo
rail; only the boundary differs. Unlike the in-runtime firewall adapters, the subject here
can come from a **validated** identity: the OAuth access token FastMCP's auth layer
verified for the request — never from anything the model produced.

Subject resolution (first match wins; no match refuses the call):

1. The verified access token's ``sub`` claim → ``Subject(type="user", id=<sub>)``
   (``subject_claim`` / ``subject_type`` are constructor knobs). A token *without* a
   usable claim refuses — unless ``allow_workload_subject=True``, which maps such a
   client-credentials token to the distinct ``Subject(type="workload", id=<client_id>)``
   so machine policies are written on their own terms; a workload identity is **never**
   coerced into a user subject or silently downgraded to a fallback.
2. A host-injected trusted subject: ``current_request_context["subject"]`` or
   :func:`~apparitor.mapping.subject_scope` — out-of-band, as with the other adapters.
3. ``config.agent_id``, **only** when ``allow_static_subject=True``. Off by default: on a
   network transport a static fallback would authorize every anonymous caller as that one
   subject (a confused deputy). Opt in only for local/stdio servers.

The default mapper is :class:`~apparitor.mapping.MCPResourceMapper`, so the resource id is
server-scoped (``"<server>/<tool>"``): ``server_label`` if given, else the name of the
FastMCP server the call arrived on. Renaming the server changes resource ids (and
ALLOW-cache keys), and under server composition (``mount``) the derived name is not stable
across the supported FastMCP range — a child-mounted server is seen as the parent's name on
2.14 but the child's on 3.x. **Pin ``server_label`` whenever the server may be renamed or
mounted** so policy keys stay stable.

Verdict mapping is fail-closed: only a clean ``ALLOW`` reaches the tool. ``BLOCK``,
``HUMAN_REVIEW`` (MCP has no human-in-the-loop pause; refusal is surfaced distinctly so a
host can escalate), mapper abstention (``SKIP`` — here always exactly one call is
submitted, so abstention would otherwise silently execute) and any error refuse by raising
``ToolError``. Refusal messages are deliberately generic: ``ToolError`` text reaches the
(untrusted) client and model, so the rich verdict/reason stays in the operator decision
log and metrics. Note the decision log records the subject id — with token-derived
subjects that is the OAuth ``sub``; route the ``apparitor`` logger accordingly.

Enforcement scope: ``tools/call``, ``resources/read`` (action ``resource.read``, resource
``{type: "mcp_resource", id: <uri>}`` — URIs are kept verbatim, with the server label in
``properties``), and ``prompts/get`` (action ``prompt.get``, resource
``{type: "mcp_prompt", id: "<server>/<prompt>"}``) are all gated by default, each behind
the same subject chain and fail-closed verdict mapping; ``gate_resources`` /
``gate_prompts`` opt a hook out where only tool gating is wanted. Resource *templates*
reach the gate with the concrete expanded URI, so policies over templates need
wildcard/prefix matching. ``tools/list`` shaping is opt-in (``filter_listings=True``):
advisory UX that hides tools whose ``tools/call`` the subject would be denied (one batch
PDP round trip per listing — MCP clients re-list often, so budget the PDP accordingly —
and anything not a clean ALLOW, or any fault, hides). Visibility caveats: PDP policy
changes alter what a re-list returns but emit no ``list_changed`` notification, and only
``tools/list`` is filtered — ``resources/list``, ``resources/templates/list`` and
``prompts/list`` still advertise names/URIs to every caller even though reads/gets are
gated. The ``mapper`` parameter governs tool calls and listing filtering; resource/prompt
tuples are shaped by the adapter itself (they are not tool calls), so a custom mapper does
not affect them. Deployment requirements: register the middleware on every server whose
components must be gated (a mounted sub-server is covered only when calls flow through
the parent) and order it after any custom auth middleware so the token is populated.
FastMCP never tears middleware down, so closing is the host's job (``aclose()``).
